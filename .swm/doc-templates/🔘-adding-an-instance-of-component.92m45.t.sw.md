Understanding [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc)s and how they work is an important part of contributing to our system.

This document will describe all you need to know about [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc)s.

A [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc) is [add a high-level description of Components are and their role in the system](#text-placeholder-id-jhqz1).

Some examples of [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc)s are: [add examples here](#text-placeholder-id-ubhss)

# Basic Example

We'll follow the implementation of [Example Component (an instance of Component)](#text-placeholder-id-9oy67) for this example.

[add a high-level description of Example Component](#text-placeholder-id-7e7ko).

# TL;DR

1.  Create a class inheriting from [base class](#text-placeholder-id-gggqo) in [add a "/path" of a containing folder, and / or describe the file naming convention](#text-placeholder-id-7wbm4)

2.  Define [add class level variables / constants / types to define](#text-placeholder-id-exagy)

3.  Implement [add names of methods to implement](#text-placeholder-id-qpqfx)

4.  Update [add a file that needs to be updated with the new class (add class / name of class to a list, import it somewhere, etc.](#text-placeholder-id-555pz)


# Add the New Class

### Inherit from [base class](#text-placeholder-id-gggqo)

We first need to define our class in [mention relevant file](#text-placeholder-id-pjhku), and inherit from [base class](#text-placeholder-id-gggqo)

<br/>

<!-- TEMPLATE-swimm-snippet-placeholder -->
Add a snippet of the class definition of { Example Component }

<br/>

## Define [add class level variables / constants / types to define](#text-placeholder-id-exagy)

Every [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc) should define these at the class level:

*   [variable name](#text-placeholder-id-semhh): [why we need to define variable name/what it does](#text-placeholder-id-ndlwi)

*   [another variable](#text-placeholder-id-7u6mn): [why we need to define another variable/what it does](#text-placeholder-id-aqpkp)

*   ...

<br/>

<!-- TEMPLATE-swimm-snippet-placeholder -->
Add a snippet of the definitions of these variables / constants / types in { Example Component }

<br/>

# Implement [method names to implement](#text-placeholder-id-uke9s)

The goal of [first method](#text-placeholder-id-wmcbi) is to [explain what this method does](#text-placeholder-id-qmikw).

<br/>

<!-- TEMPLATE-swimm-snippet-placeholder -->
Add a snippet of implementation of { first method } in { Example Component }

<br/>

## **Update additional files with the new class**

Every time we add a new [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc), we reference it in a few locations:

<br/>

<!-- TEMPLATE-swimm-snippet-placeholder -->
Add snippets to a places where you need to update with new the new class

<br/>

## Usage example

In this example we can see how our new [Component](#text-placeholder-id-lfnuc) can be used:

<br/>

<!-- TEMPLATE-swimm-snippet-placeholder -->
Show a usage example of { Example Component }
