Understanding { Component }s and how they work is an important part of contributing to our system.

This document will describe all you need to know about { Component }s.

A { Component } is { add a high-level description of Components are and their role in the system }.

Some examples of { Component }s are: { add examples here }

# Basic Example

We'll follow the implementation of { Example Component (an instance of Component) } for this example.

{ add a high-level description of Example Component }.

# TL;DR

1.  Create a class inheriting from { base class } in { add a "/path" of a containing folder, and / or describe the file naming convention }
    
2.  Define { add class level variables / constants / types to define }
    
3.  Implement { add names of methods to implement }
    
4.  Update { add a file that needs to be updated with the new class (add class / name of class to a list, import it somewhere, etc. }
    

# Add the New Class

### Inherit from { base class }

We first need to define our class in { mention relevant file }, and inherit from { base class }

## Define { add class level variables / constants / types to define }

Every { Component } should define these at the class level:

*   { variable name }: { why we need to define it/what it does }
    
*   { another variable }: { why we need to define it/what it does }
    
*   ...

# Implement { method names to implement }

The goal of { first method } is to { explain what this method does }.

## **Update additional files with the new class**

Every time we add a new { Component }, we reference it in a few locations:

<br/>

## Usage example

In this example we can see how our new { Component } can be used:
