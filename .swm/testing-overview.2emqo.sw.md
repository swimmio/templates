## Testing Frameworks

We use { framework } for unit tests, and { framework } for our end-to-end tests.

## Running Tests Locally

### Configure Automation User and Password

To run the tests, you first need to configure the user and password.

### Run the tests

You can then use the following commands to run tests:

```
yarn test
```

## Writing tests

### Assertions

{ Add examples of common assertions used by tests }

<br/>



<br/>

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, {path for a test file} tests the {feature's name} feature.

{ Add specific best practices you would like to share }
